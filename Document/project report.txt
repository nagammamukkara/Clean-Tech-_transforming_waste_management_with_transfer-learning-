📚 Introduction:
Modern waste management systems require scalable, efficient, and automated solutions. Manual waste sorting is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable in the long term. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Clean Tech solutions offer an effective alternative. Transfer learning allows the use of powerful pretrained models, saving computational resources and training time, especially when data availability is limited.

🎯 Objectives:
Build a deep learning model using transfer learning for waste classification.

Train and evaluate the model using a labeled dataset (e.g., TrashNet).

Develop a web interface for easy user interaction and image uploads.

Promote sustainable practices through AI-based waste recognition.

🧪 Methodology:
Dataset:

Used the TrashNet dataset, which contains images of waste in 6 categories: paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, glass, and organic.

Data Preprocessing:

Image resizing, normalization, augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom).

Transfer Learning:

Used ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet.

Final classification layers were replaced with task-specific layers.

Base layers frozen initially, then fine-tuned on the dataset.

Model Training:

Framework: TensorFlow/Keras.

Optimizer: Adam, Learning Rate: 1e-4, Epochs: 10–15.

Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Loss.

Train/Validation split: 80/20.

Deployment:

Developed a Flask web application to host the model.

Users upload images, and the model predicts the waste category.

🧠 Model Architecture:
Base Model: ResNet50 (pretrained)

Input Shape: (224, 224, 3)

Custom Head:

GlobalAveragePooling2D

Dense(128, ReLU)

Dense(6, Softmax)

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Training Time: ~10 mins on GPU

🌐 Web Application:
Framework: Flask

Functionality:

Upload waste image

View prediction result

Display image + label

Frontend: HTML, CSS (basic)

Backend: Python (Flask), TensorFlow

📊 Results:
Class	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Plastic	0.90	0.89	0.89
Metal	0.91	0.88	0.89
Organic	0.86	0.84	0.85
Paper	0.92	0.94	0.93
Glass	0.87	0.89	0.88
Cardboard	0.89	0.90	0.89

Overall Accuracy: ~89%

Inference Time: ~0.2s/image

⚠️ Challenges:
Imbalanced dataset: Some waste categories had fewer samples.

Background noise in images.

Differentiating between visually similar items (e.g., plastic vs. glass).

Limited edge deployment optimization.

✅ Conclusion:
This project demonstrates that transfer learning can effectively classify waste images, making it a valuable tool in smart waste management systems. It reduces human effort, increases recycling efficiency, and supports clean tech goals.

🔮 Future Work:
Expand to more waste categories (e.g., electronics, batteries).

Deploy on mobile or edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano).

Integrate with IoT-based smart bins.

Use real-time video classification.

Improve accuracy with larger datasets and advanced augmentation.
